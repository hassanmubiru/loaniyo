# Quick Farcaster Setup Guide

## 🚀 **Fastest Way to Get Your FID**

### **Option 1: Manual Check (No API Key Needed)**

1. **Visit your Warpcast profile:**
   - Go to: https://warpcast.com/hassanmubiru
   - Check if the profile exists and note your FID

2. **Check Farcaster Network:**
   - Visit: https://farcaster.network/hassanmubiru
   - Look for your FID and custody address

### **Option 2: Get Free API Key (Recommended)**

1. **Go to [neynar.com](https://neynar.com)**
2. **Sign up for free account**
3. **Get your API key**
4. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   # Edit the script with your API key first
   nano scripts/get-fid-simple.js
   
   # Then run it
   node scripts/get-fid-simple.js
   ```

## 🔍 **What You Need to Find**

- **FID**: Your unique Farcaster ID (e.g., 12345)
- **Username**: Your Farcaster username (e.g., hassanmubiru)
- **Custody Address**: The wallet address that owns your Farcaster account

## 📝 **Current Status**

Your `farcaster.json` currently has:
```json
"allowedAddresses": ["hassanmubiru"]
```

This should be your **custody address** (wallet address), not your username.

## 🚨 **If Username Doesn't Exist**

If "hassanmubiru" doesn't exist on Farcaster:
1. **Create a Farcaster account** at [warpcast.com](https://warpcast.com)
2. **Choose a username** (can be different from "hassanmubiru")
3. **Get your FID and custody address**
4. **Update your configuration**

## 🔧 **Next Steps After Getting Info**

1. **Update `allowedAddresses`** with your actual custody address
2. **Generate cryptographic proof** using your Farcaster wallet
3. **Update `accountAssociation`** with real credentials
4. **Redeploy to Netlify**

## 💡 **Quick Test**

Try visiting these URLs to see if your profile exists:
- https://warpcast.com/hassanmubiru
- https://farcaster.network/hassanmubiru

If they return 404, you need to create a Farcaster account first!
